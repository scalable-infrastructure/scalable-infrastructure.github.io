## Course Overview

**Location:** LMU Öttingenstr 67, 80538 München

**Instructor(S):**  

* Professor Dr. Dieter Kranzlmüller
* Dr. Andre Luckow, <andre.luckow@ifi.lmu.de>
* Maximilian Höb, <hoebm@nm.ifi.lmu.de>

The ongoing data deluge driven by the increasing digitalization of science,
society and industry, leads to a significant increase in demand for data
storage, processing and analytics within several industrial domains. Sciences
and industry are overwhelmed by the need to store large amounts of
transactional and machine-generated data resulting from the customer, service
and manufacturing processes. Examples of machine- generated data are server
logs as well as sensor data that is generated in finer granularities and
frequencies. Further, datasets are often enriched with web and open data from
social media, blogs or other open data sources. The Internet of Things (IoT)
will further blur the boundaries between the physical and the digital world
causing an even further increase in the digital footprint of the world. In this
course, we will learn about data applications and their requirements. Further,
we will discuss the core infrastructure necessary to handle the large data
volumes and analytical problems. As part of the exercises students will utilize
different frameworks, e.g. MapReduce and Spark to implement different
algorithms.

## Attendance

Attendance in all classes is required. Students with more than 3 unexcused absences will not receive a passing grade in the class. An unexcused absence is any absence for which the instructor was not notified before the start of the class. If instructor does not show up on-time for class, students are expected to wait at least 15 minutes before leaving.


## Academic Integrity Statement 

As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemson's vision of this institution as a “high seminary of learning.” Fundamental to this vision is a mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or stealing in any form.
